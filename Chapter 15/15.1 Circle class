"""
Exercise 15.1. Write a definition for a class named Circle with attributes center and radius,
where center is a Point object and radius is a number.
Instantiate a Circle object that represents a circle with its center at (150, 100) and radius 75.
Write a function named point_in_circle that takes a Circle and a Point and returns True if the
Point lies in or on the boundary of the circle.
Write a function named rect_in_circle that takes a Circle and a Rectangle and returns True if
the Rectangle lies entirely in or on the boundary of the circle.
Write a function named rect_circle_overlap that takes a Circle and a Rectangle and returns
True if any of the corners of the Rectangle fall inside the circle. Or as a more challenging version,
return True if any part of the Rectangle falls inside the circle.
