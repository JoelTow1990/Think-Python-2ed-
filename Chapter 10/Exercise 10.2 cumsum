Exercise 10.2. Write a function called cumsum that takes a list of numbers and returns the cumulative sum; that is, a new list where the ith element is the sum of the first i + 1 elements from the
original list. For example:
>>> t = [1, 2, 3]
>>> cumsum(t)
[1, 3, 6]
'''
def cumsum(t):
    '''Assumes t is a list of numbers'''
    value = 0
    output = []
    for number in t:
        value += number
        output.append(value)
    return output
'''Returns a list such that the ith element is the sum of the first i+1 elements in t'''
