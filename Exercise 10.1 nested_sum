Exercise 10.1. Write a function called nested_sum that takes a list of lists of integers and adds up
the elements from all of the nested lists. For example:
>>> t = [[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> nested_sum(t)
21

def nested_sum(t):
    '''Assumes t is a list of lists'''
    Answer = 0
    for lists in t:
        Answer+=sum(lists)
    return Answer
'''Returns the sum of the elements from every list in t'''
